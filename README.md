# CAPTCHAUtils
Set of PHP classes to reduce duplication of code used to verify various CAPTCHA-esque things (Cloudflare Turnstile and hCAPTCHA) that don't have their own maintained packages. Google's ReCAPTCHA is deliberately omitted since they publish their own PHP package.

ALTCHA support may be added when I can verify that their own libraries don't support thier open source implementation of CATPCHA.
